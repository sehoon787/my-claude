## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Leadership** | Boss orchestrates, never implements. Leads teams with peer-to-peer communication, dynamic composition, and file ownership protocols |
| **Discovery** | Runtime capability matching — no hardcoded routing tables. Every agent, skill, and MCP server is auto-discovered at session start |
| **Verification** | Trust but verify. Every subagent result is independently checked before acceptance |

## Quick Start

### If you are a human

**Option 1: Install via Claude Code plugin**

```bash
# Inside a Claude Code session:
/plugin marketplace add sehoon787/my-claude
/plugin install my-claude@my-claude
```

Then install companion tools (npm packages + Anthropic skills):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sehoon787/my-claude.git /tmp/my-claude
bash /tmp/my-claude/install.sh
rm -rf /tmp/my-claude
```

**Option 2: Automated script**

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sehoon787/my-claude.git /tmp/my-claude && bash /tmp/my-claude/install.sh && rm -rf /tmp/my-claude
```

> **Note**: `install.sh` automatically sets Boss as the default agent. For plugin install (Option 1), run the setup command in [AI-INSTALL.md](AI-INSTALL.md).
>
> **Agent Packs**: Domain specialist agents (marketing, sales, gamedev, etc.) are installed to `~/.claude/agent-packs/` and can be activated by symlinking to `~/.claude/agents/` when needed.

**Option 3: Manual installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sehoon787/my-claude.git
```

Then follow the instructions in `SETUP.md` to copy the files.

### If you are an LLM agent

Fetch the AI installation guide and execute each step:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sehoon787/my-claude/main/AI-INSTALL.md
```

Read the full output and execute each step in order. Use `curl`, not `WebFetch`. For human-readable step-by-step setup, see `SETUP.md`.

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Boss Dynamic Meta-Orchestrator**: Auto-discovers all installed agents, skills, and MCP servers at runtime — routes tasks via 3D conflict resolution (Scope/Depth×2/Interactivity). Handles mid-sized tasks directly (P3a) without sub-orchestrator overhead
- **Agent Teams Direct Leadership**: Boss can lead Agent Teams directly (Priority 3c-DIRECT) with peer-to-peer teammate communication, file ownership protocol, and Review Chain patterns for quality assurance
- **Sub-Orchestrators (P3b)**: When tasks are too complex for direct handling, Boss delegates to Sisyphus (planning+verification), Atlas (task coordination), or Hephaestus (autonomous execution) — only for complex multi-step workflows, not every request
- **Skill vs Agent Conflict Resolution**: Weighted 3-dimensional scoring (Scope, Depth×2, Interactivity) determines whether to use a Skill or Agent for each task — no hardcoded routing tables
- **Model-Optimized Routing**: Automatically selects Opus (high complexity) / Sonnet (implementation) / Haiku (exploration) based on task complexity

### Runtime Behavioral Correction
- **Delegation Guard** (PreToolUse): Forces sub-agent delegation when the orchestrator attempts to directly modify files
- **Subagent Verifier** (SubagentStop): Forces independent verification after a sub-agent completes its work
- **Completion Check** (Stop): Confirms all tasks are completed and verified before allowing the session to end

### External Knowledge Integration (MCP)
- **Context7**: Retrieves official library documentation in real time
- **Exa**: Semantic web search (1,000 free requests per month)
- **grep.app**: GitHub open-source code search

### All-in-One Bundle
- Plugin install provides **186 agents, 156 skills, and 65 rules** instantly
- Bundles 3 MIT upstream sources (agency-agents, everything-claude-code, oh-my-claudecode)
- Weekly CI auto-sync keeps bundled content up-to-date with upstream
- Companion `install.sh` adds npm tools and proprietary Anthropic skills

## Core + OMO Agents

**Boss** is the only my-claude original agent. The remaining 9 are [OMO agents](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent) that Boss uses as sub-orchestrators and specialists. The plugin bundles **52 core agents** (Core 1 + OMO 9 + Engineering 23 + OMC 19 + OMO specialists) always loaded into `~/.claude/agents/`, plus **150 domain agent-packs** in `~/.claude/agent-packs/` that can be activated on demand. Boss selects the best-matching specialist from all active agents via Priority 2 capability matching. See [Installed Components](#installed-components) below.

| Agent | Source | Model | Role |
|---------|--------|------|------|
| **Boss** | my-claude | Opus | Dynamic meta-orchestrator. Auto-discovers all installed agents/skills/MCP at runtime and routes to optimal specialist |
| **Sisyphus** | OMO | Opus | Sub-orchestrator. Manages complex multi-step workflows with intent classification and verification |
| **Hephaestus** | OMO | Opus | Autonomous deep worker. Autonomously performs explore → plan → execute → verify cycles |
| **Metis** | OMO | Opus | Pre-execution intent analysis. Structures requests before execution to prevent AI-slop |
| **Atlas** | OMO | Opus | Master task orchestrator. Decomposes and coordinates complex tasks with a 4-stage QA cycle |
| **Oracle** | OMO | Opus | Strategic technical advisor. Analyzes in read-only mode without modifying code and provides direction |
| **Momus** | OMO | Opus | Task plan reviewer. Reviews plans from an approval-biased perspective. Read-only |
| **Prometheus** | OMO | Opus | Interview-based planning consultant. Clarifies requirements through conversation |
| **Librarian** | OMO | Sonnet | Open-source documentation research agent using MCP |
| **Multimodal-Looker** | OMO | Sonnet | Visual analysis agent. Analyzes images/screenshots. Read-only |

---

## Agent Packs (Domain Specialists)

Domain specialist agents are installed to `~/.claude/agent-packs/` and are **not** loaded by default. Activate a pack by symlinking it into `~/.claude/agents/`:

```bash
# Activate a single pack
ln -s ~/.claude/agent-packs/marketing/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Deactivate
rm ~/.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md
```

| Pack | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| marketing | 27 | Douyin, Xiaohongshu, WeChat OA, TikTok |
| gamedev | 19 | Unity, Unreal, Godot, Roblox |
| engineering-domain | 8 | Mobile, Solidity, Embedded, Feishu |
| sales | 9 | SDR, Account Executive, Revenue Ops |

## How Boss Works

### Harness vs Orchestrator vs Agent

| Concept | Role | Analogy | Examples |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| **Harness** | Runtime platform that executes agents — manages lifecycle, tools, permissions | Operating System | Claude Code, omo |
| **Orchestrator** | Special agent that coordinates other agents — classifies intent, delegates, verifies. Never implements directly | Conductor | Boss, Sisyphus, Atlas |
| **Agent** | Execution unit that performs actual work in a specific domain — writes code, analyzes, reviews | Musician | debugger, executor, security-reviewer |

```
Harness (Claude Code)
 └─ Boss (Meta-Orchestrator)         — discovers all, routes optimally
     ├─ Skill invocation              — pdf, docx, tdd-workflow, etc.
     ├─ Direct agent delegation       — debugger, security-reviewer, etc.
     ├─ Sisyphus (Sub-Orchestrator)   — complex workflow management
     │   ├─ Metis → intent analysis
     │   ├─ Prometheus → planning
     │   └─ Hephaestus → autonomous execution
     └─ Atlas (Sub-Orchestrator)      — task decomposition + QA cycles
```

### Delegation Mechanism (4-Priority Routing)

Boss routes every request through a 4-level priority chain:

| Priority | Match Type | When | Example |
|----------|-----------|------|---------|
| **1** | Exact Skill match | Task maps to a self-contained skill | "merge PDFs" → `Skill("pdf")` |
| **2** | Specialist Agent match | Domain-specific agent exists | "security audit" → `Agent("Security Engineer")` |
| **3a** | Direct orchestration | 2-4 independent agents | "fix 3 bugs" → Boss parallel |
| **3b** | Sub-orchestrator delegation | Complex multi-step workflow | "refactor + test" → Sisyphus |
| **3c** | Agent Teams (direct leadership) | Peer-to-peer communication needed | "implement + review" → Review Chain |
| **4** | General-purpose fallback | No specialist matches | "explain this" → `Agent(model="sonnet")` |

Every delegation includes a **6-section structured prompt**: TASK, EXPECTED OUTCOME, REQUIRED TOOLS, MUST DO, MUST NOT DO, CONTEXT.

### Delegation Examples

#### Subagent vs Agent Teams

| | Subagent (P2/P3a/P3b) | Agent Teams (P3c) |
|---|---|---|
| **Command** | `Agent(prompt="...")` | `SendMessage(to: "agent", ...)` |
| **Communication** | Boss → Agent → Boss | Boss ↔ Agent ↔ Agent |
| **Lifetime** | Ends on completion | Persists until TeamDelete |
| **Visibility** | Boss log only | tmux pane or Shift+↓ |
| **Cost** | Low | High (separate Claude session per teammate) |

**P2 — Single Specialist Agent:**
```
$ claude "analyze auth module for security vulnerabilities"

[Boss] Phase 0: Scanning... 201 agents, 148 skills ready.
[Boss] Phase 1: Intent → Security Analysis | Priority: P2
[Boss] Phase 2: Matched → security-reviewer (sonnet)
[Boss] Agent(description="security review", model="sonnet", prompt="
  TASK: Analyze src/auth/ for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
  MUST DO: Check SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.
  MUST NOT: Modify any files.
")
       ↓ result returned
[Boss] Phase 4: Reading report... 2 critical, 1 medium confirmed. ✓
```

**P3a — Boss Direct Parallel:**
```
$ claude "refactor auth and write tests"

[Boss] Phase 1: Multi-step → P3a Direct Orchestration
[Boss] Spawning 2 agents in parallel:
  Agent(description="executor refactoring", model="sonnet", run_in_background=true)
  Agent(description="test-engineer tests", model="sonnet", run_in_background=true)
       ↓ both results returned
[Boss] Phase 4: Verifying refactored files... ✓
[Boss] Phase 4: Running tests... 12/12 passed. ✓
```

**P3c — Agent Teams:**
```
$ claude "implement payment module with review"

[Boss] Phase 1: Needs inter-agent communication → P3c Agent Teams
[Boss] TeamCreate → 2 teammates spawned (tmux split-pane)
[Boss] TaskCreate("Implement payment", assignee="executor")
[Boss] TaskCreate("Review payment", assignee="code-reviewer")
[Boss] SendMessage(to: "executor", "Implement src/payment/ using Stripe SDK")

  ┌─ executor (tmux pane 1) ──────────────────┐
  │ Working on src/payment/...                  │
  │ SendMessage(to: "code-reviewer",            │
  │   "Implementation done, review src/payment/")│

[Boss] All tasks completed → TeamDelete
```

For detailed agent compatibility matrix and team communication patterns, see [Agent Teams Reference](agents/core/agent-teams-reference.md).

### Scope Discovery (Global + Project)

Boss discovers components from **two scopes** that merge at runtime:

| Scope | Agents | Skills | MCP Servers |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/agents/*.md` | `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| **Project** | `.claude/agents/*.md` | `.claude/skills/` | `.mcp.json` |

When running `claude` in a project directory, Boss sees both global and project-level components. Project-level agents with the same name as global ones take priority (project-specific customization).

## Agent Overlap Guide

OMC and omo have agent pairs with overlapping functionality. Keep both and choose based on the situation.

| Function | OMC | omo | Selection Criteria |
|------|-----|-----|-----------|
| Planning | planner | Prometheus | Quick tasks → OMC planner, complex projects → omo Triad (Metis → Prometheus → Momus) |
| Code Review | code-reviewer | Momus | OMC: focused review, omo: includes AI-slop detection |
| Exploration | explore | Explore | Use whichever belongs to the current platform |

**omo-exclusive agents (6):** Sisyphus, Sisyphus-Junior, Hephaestus, Oracle, Multimodal-Looker, Librarian

**OMC-exclusive agents (14):** analyst, architect, code-simplifier, critic, debugger, designer, document-specialist, executor, git-master, qa-tester, scientist, test-engineer, verifier, writer

For a detailed analysis, see the [Agent Overlap Analysis in SETUP.md](./SETUP.md#11-agent-overlap-analysis-omc-vs-omo).
